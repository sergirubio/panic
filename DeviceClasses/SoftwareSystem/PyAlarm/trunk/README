# PyAlarm Device Server
# https://svn.code.sf.net/p/tango-ds/code/DeviceClasses/SoftwareSystem/PyAlarm/tags/latest/panic/ds

PyAlarm is the alarm device server used by ALBA Alarm System, it requires PyTango and Fandango modules, 
both available from tango-cs.sourceforge.net

Some configuration panels in the GUI require PyAlarm to be available in the PYTHONPATH, to do so you can 
add the PyAlarm.py folder to the PYTHONPATH variable or copy the PyAlarm.py file within the panic folder; 
so it could be loaded as a part of the module.


# Panic GUI
